            <strong>Urban Context and Challenges:</strong><br>
 Today, nearly 80% of Latin America’s population lives in cities, yet the qualitative experience of urban life continues to deteriorate in the absence of equitable and ecological spatial strategies (UN, 2018). From 1950 to 2010, Cuenca expanded its urban footprint from 288 hectares to over 7,200 hectares, while its population density declined from 138 to just over 45 inhabitants per hectare (INEC, 2010; Carpio, 1979). This shift was not simply demographic—it reflected structural transformations in the logic of urban growth. A city is increasingly defined as a discontinuous model of a discontinuous city, where territorial expansion outpaces demographic density and where the periphery is designed to absorb single-family dwellings in a pattern of unsustainable land consumption (Lehmann, 2010; Navarro, 2011; Muñiz et al., 2010; Arbury, 2005).

At the heart of this transformation was the regulatory plan developed in the late 1940s by Uruguayan architect Gilberto Gatto Sobral, which proposed a rationalised zoning scheme for Cuenca. While formally modernist in design—dividing the city into residential, commercial, and industrial zones—this model failed in practice due to its incompatibility with Cuenca’s social and spatial fabric. As Carpio (1979) notes, the plan presupposed an industrial social structure that never materialised, and unregulated private interests ultimately undermined it. 

Consequently, the colonial grid of Cuenca remained dominant until the 1950s, after which a series of territorial policies accelerated peripheralisation (Carrión, 1998). These changes intensified with the decline of the local hat export economy and the rise of rudimentary industrialisation and speculative urbanisation in the 1960s and beyond.
The impacts of this unstructured growth extend beyond the built environment. They manifest socially, economically, and ecologically—producing fragmented infrastructures, increased dependence on private vehicles, spatial segregation, and rising infrastructural and energy costs (Gakenheimer, 2011; Muñiz et al., 2010). Cuenca’s case is, therefore, not isolated but part of a wider Latin American condition, marked by the neoliberal withdrawal of the state, informal expansion, and weak planning enforcement (De Mattos, 2010; Borsdorf, 2003).

          <strong>Vision</strong><br>
          Drawing on the superblock model developed in Barcelona by Salvador Rueda, the principles of hybrid urbanism articulated by Manuel Gausa, and the human-scale approaches of Alexander, Gehl, and Jacobs, this vision for Cuenca seeks to reimagine streets as civic spaces and reclaim public space as the foundation of urban life. It shifts the focus from mobility-centric planning toward a renewed emphasis on social, ecological, and everyday experience—resisting horizontal expansion and instead promoting density through pedestrian-oriented design, local identity, and ecological integration. The aim is not to replicate European models, but to construct a situated, Andean alternative grounded in collective knowledge, territorial specificity, and lived spatial practices.

          <strong>Implementation and Vision:</strong><br>
          The urban design concept of Superblock Cuenca addresses the historic centre of Cuenca as a dynamic and complex urban landscape that has been spatially fragmented and socially segregated by decades of unchecked territorial expansion, car-dominated infrastructure, and zoning models inherited from modernist planning. The proposal introduces a cross-scalar, multi-layered spatial strategy that operates simultaneously at the territorial, urban, architectural, and typological levels. Central to this approach is the transformation of the traditional urban block through a superblock structure, consolidating nine existing blocks into a single functional unit, as tested through a pilot intervention in the nine de Octubre district.
The proposal understands that streets, long defined by their role in vehicle circulation, must be reimagined in an era where the car is no longer the central organising principle of urban life. Streets are complex infrastructures, but without the car, their latent potential for urban, architectural, social, and ecological transformation is revealed. They become connective public systems that weave together previously disconnected fabrics. These corridors, once subordinated to automotive logic, are reprogrammed to serve the citizens directly, creating a more interconnected and habitable urban ecosystem. In this new system, the urban void between sidewalks is no longer a space of fear or separation but becomes the backbone of collective life, ecological integration, and spatial continuity.
The superblock strategy reorganises the mobility hierarchy to redistribute space within the urban core. Vehicular circulation is reduced to perimeter basic roads, maintaining speeds of 50 km/h, while internal neighbourhood roads are limited to 10 km/h and prioritised for pedestrian and cyclist movement. This liberation of the inner street network generates new spatial qualities, enabling the creation of linear parks, widened sidewalks, social gathering spaces, bioswales, and green corridors. Many of these interventions reclaim space previously occupied by surface parking lots, transforming these underutilised interiors into biodiverse, shaded, and socially vibrant communal environments.

The concept is implemented in three phases. In Phase I, tactical interventions and weekend street closures are introduced as experimental actions to create awareness and collective imaginaries about alternative urban lifestyles. These acupunctural moves activate dialogue and sow the seeds for long-term transformation. Phase II formalises the road hierarchy, installing clear thresholds between basic and neighbourhood roads, and, where necessary, introduces access control systems to manage traffic and maintain low speeds within the Superblock. Phase III focuses on spatial reprogramming and integration of new uses into the public realm. It promotes mixed-use functions, greater social interaction, and increased walkability by stimulating economic activities, reducing daily travel distances, and enhancing environmental performance. The 3x3 Superblock pilot—anchored around Plaza 9 de Octubre—serves as a prototype for testing the spatial, architectural, and social capacities of the concept. It reimagines the historic street grid as a green, porous, and inclusive network. Streets of 8 to 12 metres in width, previously constrained by lanes, parking strips, and narrow sidewalks, are reconverted into civic corridors that prioritise movement on foot or by bicycle. Urban biodiversity is enhanced through soil permeability, green facades, and shading systems, while previously neglected interstitial spaces are activated as cultural and commercial nodes. The transformation is not aesthetic alone—it restores spatial dignity to the street as a place of encounter, coexistence, and ecological performance.
